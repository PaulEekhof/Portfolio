# ---- AI Development and Implementation ----

## 1. Nova Caster 🔢🤖
A Python application that combines mathematical pattern recognition with AI-powered predictions using GGUF models to predict the next number in a sequence.

### Features
  - 🌙 Dark-themed GUI with modern styling
  - 📂 CSV data import and analysis
  - 🔍 Pattern recognition for various sequences:
    - ➕ Arithmetic and geometric progressions
    - 🔄 Fibonacci-like sequences
    - 📈 Polynomial relationships
    - 🔢 Prime number patterns
    - 📊 Exponential growth/decay
    - 🔢 Modular arithmetic patterns
    - ♾️ Symmetrical sequences
    - 🧩 Factorization analysis
  - 🤖 AI-powered predictions using GGUF models
  - 🚀 Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Includes
  - 🖥️ **GUI**
    - A customtkinter GUI to provide an interactive interface.
  - 🔮 **Predictor**
    - Class to make a prediction using a locally run GGUF model.
  - 🧠 **Rules**
    - 10 rules for analyzing number sequences (like is_fibonacci_like, factorization, is_geometric).

### How It Works
The application uses a two-stage prediction process:

  1️⃣ **Mathematical Pattern Analysis**
     - 📏 Checks for common mathematical sequences
     - 🔬 Analyzes numerical relationships
     - 🔢 Identifies patterns in prime factors
  
  2️⃣ **AI-Based Prediction**
     - 🤖 Uses GGUF model for complex pattern recognition
     - 📈 Provides predictions when mathematical patterns aren't clear
     - 🎯 Combines both approaches for optimal results

## 2. Deepseek Chat 💭
A Flutter-based chat application that implements a modern chat interface with AI integration using Deepseek-r1:14b.

- 🤖 Ollama integration for running AI models
- 🧠 Support for Deepseek-r1:14b language model
- 🔌 Python server backend
- 📱 Modern Flutter chat interface
- ⚡ Real-time AI chat responses

### Includes
  - 📱 **Flutter App**
    - Full Flutter application with chat functionality.
  - 🖥️ **Backend**
    - Backend server

### How It Works
Make sure you have Ollama installed and the same model as in the server.py. You can change the model if you like. Just pull it on Ollama and change the necessary flutter and python files.

  - 🚀 Run the model on Ollama
  - 🌐 Open the server
  - 📱 Run the Flutter application to chat and interact with the model.
