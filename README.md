# ---- AI Development and Implementation ----

## 1. Nova Caster 🔢🤖
A Python application that combines mathematical pattern recognition with AI-powered predictions using GGUF models to predict the next number in a sequence.

### Features
  - 🌙 Dark-themed GUI with modern styling
  - 📂 CSV data import and analysis
  - 🔍 Pattern recognition for various sequences:
    - ➕ Arithmetic and geometric progressions
    - 🔄 Fibonacci-like sequences
    - 📈 Polynomial relationships
    - 🔢 Prime number patterns
    - 📊 Exponential growth/decay
    - 🔢 Modular arithmetic patterns
    - ♾️ Symmetrical sequences
    - 🧩 Factorization analysis
  - 🤖 AI-powered predictions using GGUF models
  - 🚀 Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Includes
  - 🖥️ **GUI**
    - A customtkinter GUI to provide an interactive interface.
  - 🔮 **Predictor**
    - Class to make a prediction using a locally run GGUF model.
  - 🧠 **Rules**
    - 10 rules for analyzing number sequences (like is_fibonacci_like, factorization, is_geometric).

### How It Works
The application uses a two-stage prediction process:

  1️⃣ **Mathematical Pattern Analysis**
     - 📏 Checks for common mathematical sequences
     - 🔬 Analyzes numerical relationships
     - 🔢 Identifies patterns in prime factors
  
  2️⃣ **AI-Based Prediction**
