## Example

Here is an example of how to use the [ChartCreator](http://_vscodecontentref_/28) and [ChartExplanation](http://_vscodecontentref_/29) classes:

```python
from models.chart_creator import ChartCreator
from models.explenation_creator import ChartExplanation

# Example dataset path
csv_path = 'datasets/medium_datasets.csv'

# Create a ChartExplanation instance
chart_explainer = ChartExplanation(
    dataset_path=csv_path,
    chart_type='Line',
    chart_params=['Month', 'Product_A']
)

# Generate chart HTML from ChartCreator
chart_creator = ChartCreator(csv_path, 'Line', ['Month', 'Product_A'])
chart_html = chart_creator.render_html()

# Combine chart with explanation
final_html = chart_explainer.render_html(chart_html)

# Print or use in your web app
print(final_html)
```
