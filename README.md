# ---- AI Development and implementation ----

# 1. Nova Caster
A Python application that combines mathematical pattern recognition with AI-powered predictions using GGUF models to predict the next number in a sequence.

## Features
  - Dark-themed GUI with modern styling
  - CSV data import and analysis
  - Pattern recognition for various sequences:
    - Arithmetic and geometric progressions
    - Fibonacci-like sequences
    - Polynomial relationships
    - Prime number patterns
    - Exponential growth/decay
    - Modular arithmetic patterns
    - Symmetrical sequences
    - Factorization analysis
  - AI-powered predictions using GGUF models
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Includes
  - GUI
    - A customtkinter gui to give the user an interface.
  - Predictor
    -  Class to make a prediction using a locally run GGUF model
  - Rules
    - 10 rules for analyzing number sequences (like; is_fibonacci_like, factorization, is_geometric)

## How It Works
The application uses a two-stage prediction process:

  1. Mathematical Pattern Analysis:
     - Checks for common mathematical sequences
     - Analyzes numerical relationships
     - Identifies patterns in prime factors
  
  2. AI-Based Prediction:
     - Uses GGUF model for complex pattern recognition
     - Provides predictions when mathematical patterns aren't clear
     - Combines both approaches for optimal results
